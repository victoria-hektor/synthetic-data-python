# Generating Synthetic Data with Python in Google Colab

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to generate **synthetic data** using Python in Google Colab. The synthetic dataset is created for **theoretical projects**, testing, or prototyping when real-world data is inaccessible. The process includes generating the data, saving it to a spreadsheet, and visualising it with various plots.

⚠️ **Note**: Synthetic data is for **learning purposes only** and should not replace real-world datasets in research or production.

## Key Features
- **Data Generation**:
  - Normally distributed (`Feature1`), uniformly distributed (`Feature2`), and exponentially distributed (`Feature3`) numerical features.
  - Randomly assigned categorical values (`Category`).
- **Data Storage**:
  - Save the generated dataset as an Excel spreadsheet in Colab.
- **Visualisation**:
  - **Matplotlib**: Histograms and scatter plots.
  - **Seaborn**: Box plots and pairplots.
  - **Interactive Plotly**: Scatter plots and bar charts.

---

## How to Use
1. **Clone or download this repository**.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
3. Run each cell to:
   - Generate a synthetic dataset.
   - Save it to a spreadsheet (`synthetic_data.xlsx`).
   - Visualise the data.

---

## Installation
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly` (install with `!pip install plotly` in Colab)

---

## Visualisation Examples
- **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of numerical data.
- **Scatter Plot**: Shows relationships between features.
- **Box Plot**: Highlights spread and outliers.
- **Bar Chart**: Summarises categorical data interactively.
